# Project 1: Neural Network Housing Prices Estimator: Project Overview
* Created a tool that can estimate a houses sale price in USD using 81 different features to assist sellers in setting an appropriate price
* Uses data from the Kaggle competition dataset, "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" to predict estimates
* Pre-processes data using One-Hot Encoding of categorical columns and mean value filling of missing values
* Optimized, simple neural network built using the PyTorch neural network library and tools like the Adam optimizer and the Mean Squared Error Loss function
* Performs accurately on test data with a R^2 value of .97
